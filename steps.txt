initial Dockerfile

Optionally creata a .dockerignore file to exclude folders and files ffrom the Docker
process. For exmple, the node_modules don't need to be included for the docker
image, becuase they will be installed in the process with npm install (see Dockerfile).
Therefore, the content of the .dockerignore file could be:

node_modules

Install docker hub to machine

Next, either login to Docker hub or create new an account. Afterward, you should 
have a Docker hub username which can be used to build Docker image.

To login --> docker login --< fill your username and password

docker build -t <username>/react-docker .


To see images that you have it--< use 

docker images


docker run --name my-react-app -p 4680:3000 -d <username>/my-react-app

To run a Docker container with a specific name, mapping of two ports and a Docker
image. Even though the Dockerfile defines a specific port, we can redirect this 
to a custom port for this particular Docker container. After creating and 
running the Docker container based on the Docker image, we should be able to
list all Docker containers:

docker ps 


Before we can visit our application in the browser, we need to 
find out the IP address of our running Docker engine:

docker-machine ip default
